whats is sliding window ? 
Sliding window is concept in which we make window of array then we will slide that window in array or traverse that window ;
ex = {1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6}
so lets take the window of two elements ex = {1 , 2} size of window = 2 

now we will traverse the window in examaple array of {1,2,3,4,5,6};
but how ? we will use two pointers method to traverse ;

step 1 -> we will use L(showcasing left most part starting index ) and R(showcasing right most part , ending index but in start R will be of same as L index);

step 2 -> now lets take example of an array = {1,2,3,4,5,6} find the length of the subarray which has sum <=14 = k;

step 3 -> nw we have Two Pattern of this concept 
                                           
Pattern 1 -> Constant Window ;
Pattern 2 -> Window which will shrink and expand its size according to question ( and mostly questions aise hi solve hote hai) ;
Pattern 3 -> We have the questions related to the subarray like find number of subarray or the array count of te subarray (in thst case we will use the pattern 3)
