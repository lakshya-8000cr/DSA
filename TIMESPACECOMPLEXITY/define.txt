1 . In simple language time complexity is how much time your code will take and space complexity is how much space your code will take 
2 . to calculate time complexity for recurisive fucntions there is a formula 


{ Time complexity = Number of recurisive calls * work in each call = O(n);
Space complexity = Depth of Recursive tree * memory in each call; }


3 . In Space complexity there is one thing that also counts which is :-

# Input Storage (not always counted)
# Auxiliary space (extra arrays, variables)
# Call stack (for recursive calls)
